# StudyHawk

</br>Date: August 4th-7th 2020
<br/> A project inspired by the study timers on [Leading Learners](https://www.leadlearners.ca/study-timer).

# About
Note: This is my first ever Python project containing a GUI! Hope you like it! :) <br/>

As most people are working from home or taking online classes, procrastination can be a huge problem.  <br/>

Introducing StudyHawk, a productivity timer that reminds you with notifications on when it is time for your break and when your break ends. <br/>
Additionally, halfway through your productivity session, you will receive a friendly notification reminding you that you should not be procrastinating, just in case if you are. When your break is about 75% over, you will also receive a friendly notification informing you that your break is almost over.
